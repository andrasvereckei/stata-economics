![The Stata interface]({{ "/img/interface.png" | relative_url }})

How do you find your current working directory? Check the bottom line of the Stata application window, or enter the command `pwd`.

![Two ways of checking your working directory]({{ "/img/pwd.png" | relative_url }})

> ## Backward or forward?
> On a Windows machine, Stata will display your working directory with a backslash (`\`) separating its components, like
> `C:\Users\koren\Dropbox\teaching\courses\2019\carpentries\stata-economics`.
> Refer to directories using a forward slash (`/`) to stay compatible with other platforms. The forward slash is understood by all three major platforms, whereas the backslash has a special meaning on Unix and Mac.

It is good practice to put the filename inside double quotes to guard against problems caused by spaces and other special characters in filenames. Note, however, that your code may not run on someone else's computer where the absolute path is different.

## Variables

Let us look at our data first. This is the first thing to do after loading a new Stata dataset.
```
browse
```
{: .source}

![Always look at your data]({{ "/img/browse.png" | relative_url }})

Stata datasets are a table of "variables" and "observations." Variables have names with which we can refer to them. Observations are rows of the table, with values for each variable. Red values in the browser are strings. We also see that Stata uses `.` for denoting missing values.


What do these variables mean? Can we use more verbose names for them?

```

{: .output}

Can we give a more verbose name to `iso_o`?

```
. rename iso_o iso_3166_alphanumeric_origin_country
1 new variable name invalid
    You attempted to rename iso_o to iso_3166_alphanumeric_origin_country.  That is an
    invalid Stata variable name.
r(198);
```
{: .error}

> ## Variable names
> Good variable names are short and descriptive. In Stata, variable names can include letters, digits, and underscores but they cannot start with a digit and are case sensitive. Variables can be at most 32 characters in length. 
{: .callout}

Variables are generated with the `generate` command and are assigned a value using `=`. 

```
generate missing_distw = 1
```
{: .source}
You can replace the values of an existing variable using command `replace`. 

```
replace missing_distw = 0 
```
{: .source}
Since Stata 14, you can use Unicode variable names, but please be gentle: your coauthors may not have the keyboard to type these names. 

```
generate tÃ¡volsÃ¡g = dist
```
{: .source}

Stata allows you to abbreviate the name of a variable to the shortest string of characters that uniquely identifies it. 

```
. describe comlang
comlang ambiguous abbreviation
r(111);

```
{: .error}

The error occurs because two variables have the same abbreviation, `comlang`, in common. If you instead ask Stata to do the following

```

. describe comlang_o

              storage   display    value
variable name   type    format     label      variable label
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
comlang_off     byte    %8.0g                 1 for common official of primary language

```
Stata will describe the variable. If you would like to know if variables in your dataset have a common abbreviation, you can use wildcards.
For example, you could refer to all variables that start with `dist` by using wildcard pattern:  `*`  that matches zero or more characters or `?` that matches exactly one character.

```
 describe dist*

              storage   display    value
variable name   type    format     label      variable label
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dist            float   %9.0g                 simple distance (most populated cities, km)
distcap         float   %9.0g                 simple distance between capitals (capitals, km)
distw           double  %9.0g                 weighted distance (pop-wt, km)
distwces        double  %9.0g                 weighted distance (pop-wt, km) CES distances
                                                with theta=-1


. describe dist?

              storage   display    value
variable name   type    format     label      variable label
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
distw           double  %9.0g                 weighted distance (pop-wt, km)

. 
```


When displaying long variable names, some Stata commands will abbreviate the variable name using `~`, making it hard to understand what variables we are dealing with. 

```
. summarize comlang_ethno 

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
comlang_et~o |     50,176    .1691645    .3749009          0          1

```
{: .output}


To avoid using long variable names, you can shorten them and provide a more detailed description about the variable using variable labels. Labels help your coauthors, including your future self, make sense of what is in the variable. For example, that is how we learn that distance is measured in kilometers, not miles. Always use them.

> ## Never abbreviate
> A quirky feature of Stata is that it lets you abbreviate everything: commands, variable names, even file names. Abbreviation might save you some typing, but destroys legibility of your code, so please think of your coauthors and your future self and never do it. 
> ```
> u data, clear
> g gdp_per_capita = 1
> ren gdp gdp
> ```
> {: .source}
> means the same as
> ```
> use "data.dta", clear
> generate gdp_per_capita = 1
> rename gdp_per_capita gdp
> ```
> {: .source}
> but the latter is much more explicit. The built-in editor of Stata 16 offers [tab completion](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/do-file-editor-autocompletion/) so you don't even have to type to write out the full command and variable names.
{: .callout}



```
. label variable iso_o "ISO3166 alphanumeric code of origin country"

. describe iso_o 

              storage   display    value

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iso_o           str3    %9s                   ISO3166 alphanumeric code of origin country

```

If you don't know or recall a command in Stata, searching the Internet will almost always turn out useful. For example, if you search `label variables Stata`, the fist link that will show up is the official Stata Manual.

## Command syntax

The `summarize` command displays summary statistics about a variable.

```
. summarize dist

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
        dist |     50,176    8481.799    4703.571   .9951369   19951.16

```
{: .output}

We can add options with a comma. For example, here is the option `detail`.

```
. summarize dist, detail

         simple distance (most populated cities, km)
-------------------------------------------------------------
      Percentiles      Smallest

50%     8084.515                      Mean           8481.799
                        Largest       Std. Dev.      4703.571
75%     12030.18       19904.45
90%     15276.66       19904.45       Variance       2.21e+07
95%     16714.46       19951.16       Skewness         .25614
99%     18569.45       19951.16       Kurtosis       2.191578
```
{: .output}

Note that here, because we have more space, the label of the variable is used, not its short name.

(Almost) every command can be run on a subset of observations, selected by an `if` condition. An if condition consists of the word `if` followed by some condition that is either true or false.

```
. summarize dist if dist < 1000, detail

         simple distance (most populated cities, km)
-------------------------------------------------------------
      Percentiles      Smallest

50%     595.3761                      Mean           563.3924
                        Largest       Std. Dev.      294.0478
75%     816.7297        998.694
90%     932.9859        998.694       Variance       86464.13
95%     969.2816       999.9088       Skewness      -.2782705
99%     996.0536       999.9088       Kurtosis       1.856825
```
{: .output}

Note that fewer observations are included because of the `if` condition. Also, as we would expect, all distances are less than 1,000km.

The `if` condition can refer to any function of any other variable, even those that are not used in the command. Here we are summarizing distance for country pairs that are contiguous (share a common border). Note that both the mean and the median distance are much smaller.

```
. summarize dist if contig == 1, detail

```
{: .output}

The operator `==` tests for equality.

You really can use any function after `if`. This is an easy way to do something on a sample for big datasets:
```
. summarize dist

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
        dist |     50,176    8481.799    4703.571   .9951369   19951.16

. set seed 17082019
. summarize dist if uniform() < 0.10

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Dev.       Min        Max
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------
        dist |      5,006    8420.376    4743.775   .9951369   19710.32

```
{: .output}

The function `uniform()` returns uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, so the above takes a 10 percent random sample from our observations.
Set the seed in order to get the same sample and results every time.  If you do not set the seed, Stata will start its algorithm with the seed 123456789. 

The `inspect` command displays a different type of summary than summarize command provided. Relevant only for numeric variables.

```
inspect dist
